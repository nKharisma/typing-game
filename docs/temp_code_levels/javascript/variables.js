// Your spaceship's radar system has detected multiple enemy ships approaching.
// To maximize your defense, you must destroy the closest enemy ship!

// Instructions
// Modify this program to calculate the distance of each enemy ship from your spaceship.
// Identify and shoot the closest enemy ship by outputting its name.

// Input
// The total number of enemy ships 'N'
// A list of ship names and their respective distances from your spaceship

// Output
// The name of the closest ship
